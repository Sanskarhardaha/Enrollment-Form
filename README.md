# Enrollment-Form

# Description

The Student Enrollment Form is a web-based application designed to facilitate the enrollment process for students in educational institutions. The form collects essential student details like Roll Number, Name, Class, Date of Birth, Address, and Enrollment Date and stores the data in JsonPowerDB (JPDB).
The project utilizes HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery), and JsonPowerDB API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seamlessly.
